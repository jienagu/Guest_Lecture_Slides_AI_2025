## What is AI, really?

-   A powerful semantic search engine that understands meaning, not just keywords

-   A Large Language Model (LLM) that learns from patterns in language

-   How it predicts “the next word” from context

## What is AI, really?

→ It looks like magic — but it’s not scary at all. It’s logic with personality.

## Build Your Own Mini AI

-   Demo: A very simple search + distance-based LLM [Link](https://github.com/jienagu/NLP_Recommendation)

-   Learn what’s actually happening behind ChatGPT in under 10 minutes:

Text → embedding → vector space → distance = similarity → Understanding the fundamentals makes AI feel less like sorcery, more like skill.

## Pros & Cons of Your AI Friend

Pros

-   knows (almost) everything on the internet

-   helps you ramp up fast — new language, new field, new idea

-   Great for brainstorming and drafting your first version

## Pros & Cons of Your AI Friend

## Pros & Cons of Your AI Friend

Cons

-   Can hallucinate — confidently wrong answers

-   Can’t access information outside its training data

→ Like a smart friend who sometimes “guesses,” so always verify.

Why It Matters?

> Executing intelligence is easy, but executing it with wisdom is hard

## AI at Work — A Force Multiplier

-   Example use case: Recommendation System

    -   Reduce manual search

    -   Guide users to what they actually need

-   Think of AI as your time-saver teammate, not a replacement → It automates the repetitive, so you can innovate the meaningful.

## Let Developers Focus on Problem-Solving

Developers often define themselves by their tools — Python, R, JavaScript. But the real superpower is **problem-solving**, not syntax.

> “Don’t fall in love with your code. Fall in love with solving the problem.”

When we focus on outcomes, we design better systems — flexible, maintainable, and truly helpful.

AI helps us shift from builders of things → solvers of needs.

## Storytime — Win User Trust

Every great AI project starts with empathy.

-   Find your users’ pain points

-   Build a RAG system (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ground answers in real data

-   Example: An internal analytics tool that helps users query data in plain English → Trust is earned when AI answers match what users already believe.

## Storytime — When AI Misleads

-   With great power comes great responsibility.

-   Validate AI output before it reaches users

-   Use feedback loops, confidence scores, and human-in-the-loop review

Admit mistakes, learn, improve → We don’t just build AI; we teach it to be trustworthy.

## Discussion — How Will You Use AI?

Prompt:

> “If you could add one AI feature to your current project or daily workflow — what would it be?”

Encourage:

-   Collaboration ideas (AI assistant for your class? A resume optimizer? A code reviewer?)

-   Discussion on ethical and creative uses

→ Making friends with AI starts with a conversation — maybe today’s one.
